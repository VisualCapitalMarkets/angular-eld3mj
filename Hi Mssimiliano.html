Hi Mssimiliano,

I've been talking with Stephane. Now, I have to show you in detail what is the present CMS and what I wish to develop. 
Since there is no job in progress, there is no reason why we couldn't use zoom for a video with screen sharing (not available on freelancer). 

Once discussed, we will see if we go on together and then possibly go through freelancer.com for best practice.

Give me your answer on fba@visualcapitalmarkets.com

Best regards

Frédéric
