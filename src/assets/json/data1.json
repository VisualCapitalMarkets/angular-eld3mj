            "title": "<h2><strong>Paths towards a digital customer experience culture</strong></h2>",
            "text": "<p><strong>How does a bank manage to offer a positive user experience across all channels? And this at a time when channels are being further digitalised? What resources are needed, and why does corporate culture take centre stage? Offering consistently positive user experiences is not an easy task, even in times of new digital channels.</strong></p><p>This much can be said: 'Nothing comes from nothing'. Without the corresponding willingness to invest and without the will to establish, expand or reconstruct a customer experience culture, success will be a long way off.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether and to what extent a financial service provider wants to make use of digitalisation possibilities depends on many factors. The degree of organisation, the process depths, the legacy of existing infrastructures, the willingness to invest and the resilience of the company are topics that a bank faces in the development and implementation of a digitalisation strategy, which are shown only in a rudimentary manner.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Marketing questions have to be answered in advance</strong></p><p>Trivial though they may seem, the four fundamental questions of marketing technique posed by Kotler in the 1970s still arise today: To which customers (1) do I offer which products or services (2) at what price (3) via which channels (4)? From the customer perspective, these questions can be formulated as follows: What (2) do I expect in my role; with what need (1) on which channel (4); where do I need support; where would I still like to be independent; and what is the price (3) I would be willing to pay for the product/service?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Focus on customer perspective</strong></p><p>In order to provide sound answers to the above questions, companies are required to consistently start from the customer perspective. We call this customer experience culture. Determining location from the customer perspective helps in formulating the identified needs and transforming them into appropriate concepts. A significant advantage of this approach lies in transparency, in the outside-in approach – so pure customer perspective – and in the possibility of gradually implementing things.</p><p><strong>New channels, new competitors</strong></p><p>Over the past 10 years, digital communications and distribution channels have been seen as a means to an end. Usability and design played a smaller role from the users' point of view. With increased pressure from challenger banks, however, it is now the traditional universal banks that need to focus intensively on the opportunities and risks of digital transformation in order to reposition themselves in the new market environment that is once again competitive. It is exciting to see that market participants with very different starting positions are in the race or are only just beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>On the basis of three selected bank types, the following graphic shows that the need for transformation could not be more different. As far as the author is concerned, the need for transformation<strong> means the sum of all additionally required investments</strong> needed to bring about a change in corporate culture, infrastructure, in the definition of the product range or in processes.</p><p style=\"margin-left:35.4pt;\"><strong>Private banking boutiques</strong><br>Private banks have a selected clientele. They primarily make investments in the personal customer relationship and still offer their customers a physical, representative presence. Personal, tailor-made, individualised support and advisory take place in appropriate locations and premises.<br>The approach is to support fewer customers, but to know them properly and advise them accordingly. The quality of advisory is and will remain crucial here. The personal contact, the location and exterior of the property, as well as the interior design of the branch are distinguishing features in the user experience.&nbsp;<br><strong>Transformation effort compared with the current business model: LOW</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:35.4pt;\"><strong>Neobanks</strong><br>They deliberately rely on the digital channel (mobile first) and on self-service. Simple products, a streamlined range and transparent fees form the prerequisites for economies of scale. The infrastructure used is chosen in accordance with a best-of-breed approach. The development of infrastructure and processes continuously takes place in the regular course of business.<br><strong>Transformation effort compared with the current business model: LOW</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:35.4pt;\"><strong>Universal banks</strong><br>Universal banks have been offering an extensive range of banking products for decades. Their internal banking processes are established and adjustments to the range usually have a direct impact on large parts of the organisation and systems. The physical distribution network should be extended with digital channels. Both hybrid and purely digital products are used for this purpose. Favourable standard offers should be made for the mass market, but personalised products and services should be provided in the individual customer business. Existing IT systems must be extended and/or converted for this purpose.<br><strong>Transformation effort compared with the current business model: HIGH</strong></p><p><strong>Invest in the future today?</strong></p><p>The lending business<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> still provides the largest share of added value today. The aggregated net income of banks in Switzerland rose by 1.1 percent compared with the previous year to CHF 66.1 billion, whereby the profit from the interest business increased by 1.0 percent despite a low-interest environment, and contributes the most to the net income.&nbsp;</p><p>Although digital transformation is only making modest and slow progress – as seen from the perspective of breadth – this can surely be attributed to the fact that the existing business model of banks operating in Switzerland still bears very good fruit. As a result, the pressure to adapt is not yet high enough. The extent to which profits are invested in future projects cannot be seen from the annual reports.</p><p><strong>User experience/customer experience (CX) as a strategic pillar</strong></p><p>Despite a comfortable starting position, the established banking institutions are becoming increasingly dynamic and are also developing a general understanding of the long-term economic added value of an investment in the (digital) customer experience.&nbsp;</p><p>But why are most banks still far from digital excellence? CX teams are often only selectively used. They are tasked with going down the path of least resistance with the fastest success, rather than exploring the solutions with the greatest effect. Therefore, when banks start the CX transformation, quick successes are sought in specific channels or in part of the company or product range. If, for example, the website is renewed and the content is reduced to the essentials, the obvious problems in this channel will also be resolved. The long-term view and management of the touchpoints appear to be no more sustainable than the retention time of management in the individual institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>What leads to sustainable success? This is achieved when the employees' CX strategy is orchestrated and implemented across the entire organisation. Customers expect the same high service level on all channels, regardless of the time. Therefore, companies sensibly invest in better data management functions so that a customer's data profile (and thus their personalisation and preferences) can flow smoothly and without delay between offline and online channels. In addition, it must first be tracked.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the implementation of a holistic CX strategy presents even experts with major challenges: existing channel structures with managers who want to optimise their specific channel can easily destroy the customer journey.</p><p>The tasks to be resolved address several areas at the same time – and this on various fronts: data (legal, ethical, consumers), people (customers, employees, business unit managers, management, technology partners) and channel (legal, technological, partnership, procedural, etc.). However, these structures are mostly not within the sphere of influence of CX experts, so they either require the consent of the channel owners or are dependent on them believing in a superordinate CX vision.</p><p><strong>Positive results thanks to CX culture ensure long-term investments in the systems</strong></p><p>The sum of the many small, positive experiences of CX investments in an organisation can create a positive cycle. The conversion of technical systems is usually financially significant, so investment can only be justified if it contributes to a positive net income – at least in the long-term view. Therefore, in order to step away from this chicken-or-egg dilemma, it is essential to gain a great deal of experience quickly and celebrate successes early and directly. If CX-focused organisations pursue this positive cycle, the differences to competitors that neglect this discipline become increasingly apparent. However, there is still a long way to go before CX itself becomes a hygiene factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Philipp Zimmermann</strong><br>Head of Product Management Digital Banking&nbsp;<br>Finnova AG</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "title": "<h2><strong>Driving forces are required for the implementation of open banking in Switzerland</strong></h2>",
            "text": "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Open banking is becoming increasingly important, especially because banks&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msocom_1\">[SB1]</a>&nbsp;wish to satisfy clients' growing need for data sovereignty. This international trend is now also gradually taking root in Switzerland. This is shown by events including the first Open Finance Roundtable, held on 23 December 2020 by the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF) with the participation of OpenBankingProject.ch. Unlike neighbouring countries (EU regulation PSD2), Switzerland is choosing a market-driven approach to the implementation of open banking.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">OpenBankingProject.ch (OBP) is one of the first initiatives to promote open banking in Switzerland and to provide key elements for the development of new business models, together with its members.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Definition of open banking</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Prof. Dr. Rainer Alt of Leipzig University describes open banking as follows: \"In accordance with the open banking concept, end clients can make their financial data accessible to different banks and financial services providers using open interfaces. Technical interfaces (API,&nbsp;SOA) and regulatory specifications (PSD2) form the bases of open banking. Open banking simplifies the creation of digital ecosystems and reduces barriers to entry for startups and non-bank businesses (fintechs, banking innovation).\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Open banking is in no way an end in itself, but rather a means of serving clients and their needs along their customer journey in the best way possible. Banks will continue to be able to sustainably understand and accompany their clients in the future as a result of this approach of opening up and providing access to data. OBP is convinced that cross-company added value will be important for remaining competitive in the long-term. Only in this way can the bank of tomorrow put together its survival kit.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Current situation and implementation in Switzerland</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In December 2020, the SIF published the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/dokumentation/publikationen/bericht-finanzmarktpolitik.html\">Confederation's current financial market policy</a>. It relies in principle on the traditional Swiss strengths of high productivity, stability, security and trust, which are combined with an open attitude towards new technological and international developments. With regard to open banking, the SIF wishes to dedicate itself to an opening up of the financial services sector and to a standardisation of data interfaces driven by the sector. Furthermore, fair competition should be ensured along with the desire to address concentration risks sensibly. Lastly, the export capacity of financial services should also be improved and the effective implementation of international standards should be promoted by the Confederation.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the past few years, a movement has emerged in relation to open banking in Switzerland (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swissbanking.org/en/topics/digitisation/open-banking-and-standardised-interfaces-apis/open-banking-and-standardised-interfaces-apis?set_language=en\">SBA working group</a>, SIX's operative platform,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/banking-services/blink.html\">b.Link</a>, SFTI's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.common-api.ch/index.php/en/\">Common API</a> project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openbankingproject.ch/en/\">OpenBankingProject.ch</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openwealth.ch/\">Open Wealth</a>). These initiatives attempt to coordinate with each other and to harness synergies. However, as before, specific use cases are rare and the necessary bases and prerequisites, such as established standards (e.g. for API, contracts, third-party provider certifications), are limited.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Only a few banks are addressing open banking seriously and are starting to implement first use cases in this context. Nevertheless, interest is visibly growing.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Services of OpenBankingProject.ch according to needs</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">OpenBankingProject.ch aims to work with its members to fill in gaps existing in Switzerland in the context of open banking, and to remove the obstacles for all companies (banks, third-party providers, etc.) involved. The initiative includes activities such as the utilisation of standards, the visualisation of actors, the preparation of knowledge and not least the networking of companies. They adopt the open source approach, with which deliverables are made available to all.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In December 2019, as a first interface for Switzerland, OpenBankingProject.ch launched the Swiss NextGen API for querying account information and initiating payment orders according to the specifications valid in Switzerland. The API is based on the open industry standard NextGenPSD2 of the European 'Berlin Group' standards initiative. This initiative is widespread in Europe and is being further developed on a continuous basis. Over the past few months, a further API – which will be further developed – has been made available for use in the area of 'bankable assets', with over 20 companies from the financial services sector.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Based on these APIs, Swiss companies and especially banks can create new offers for their clients efficiently and in a future-proof manner. Common, standardised APIs decrease the duration of implementation, minimise costs and reduce investment risks, particularly if international compatibility is guaranteed. The first actual implementations are expected this year.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A common approach in technical activities is a first step in the direction of efficient implementation of open banking in Switzerland. Further elements such as contract templates, a common certification procedure and broad-based cooperation between companies are necessary. For this reason, OBP is operating a knowledge platform (<a href=\"http://www.obp.ch\">www.obp.ch</a>), which not only provides fundamental knowledge, but also makes actors visible and makes further, jointly developed elements available.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In September 2020, the first Open Banking Summit was held with international speakers and around 100 decision-makers from the Swiss financial industry. Networking between the OBP members was also encouraged. Links have been established and joint implementation projects have been started as a result of the direct access to the relevant contact partners and the mutual exchange on respective strategies and activities.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A current implementation example is the 'Best Payment Method for E-Commerce' project, which involves over 15 companies from various sectors. The launch of the 'Friends &amp; Family' pilot operation is planned for mid-2021. The aim of the project is to establish an open and very efficient payment network.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">OpenBankingProject.ch achieved great resonance in 2020 and has experienced strong growth. Altogether, in addition to the founding partners, 13 members and an 1 additional partner now support the initiative. Between them, further elements for open banking in Switzerland are being created and the next Open Banking Summit is already being planned.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The project is an open initiative and looks forward to your involvement.</p>",
